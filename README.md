## Image Classifier with TensorFlow


### Description


By training an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. Weâ€™ll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories. Predicting flower name from an image with predict.py along with the probability of that name, after you pass in an image. This can be used as a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at.
